# Classify Sentiment Pipeline Component for [Rasa Open Source](https://github.com/rasahq/rasa)

-----

A trivial wrapper component implementing the **[Forte](https://github.com/asyml/forte)** NLP toolkit for building Natural Language Processing pipelines. This component aims to not only ensure it occupies a smallfootprit but most importantly supply a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is empirically validated by multiple independent human judges. 

This component is ultimately powered by the [VADER lexicon](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) providing a long awaited'gold-standard' sentiment lexicon to Rasa that is especially attuned to microblog-like contexts.
